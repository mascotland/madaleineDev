# Linked List
  A linked list is a list of nodes (elements) represented by head and a tail. Insted of indexes linked lists use pointers  to other nodes Linked lists have two data structures singly linked list and doubly linked list

    - Linked lists have constant-time insertions and deletions because we can change the pointer
    - Arrays use linear time because items need to be shifted over.
